Assignment 2

Source Files: intarray.cpp, 2darray.cpp, zeroboth.cpp, salestax.cpp, conversion.cpp

The limitations I had on this assignment was figuring out how to use addresses or '&'.
Everything runs perfectly, just found the conversion problem challenging.

I did reference a classmate, Frank, to get a better understanding in conversion.
I used a similar method of getting the user input.
